        <p>
                    As a 2nd-year Computer Science student, I see AI as something both exciting and a little scary. It's amazing how machines can now learn, make decisions, and even understand some human language. At the same time, I wonder how far it will go and what it means for our jobs in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning about AI in school has shown me its power and limits. Most AI today depends on data, algorithms, and human guidance. It can solve problems fast, but it can't think or feel like a person. This makes me think that while AI can help us a lot, we still need to understand it well and use it responsibly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also feel that AI is changing the way we learn and work. For example, it can help automate boring tasks, analyze information faster, and even suggest solutions we might not see. But as a student, I know I still need to practice coding, problem-solving, and creativity, because AI can assist, but it can’t replace understanding.
        </p>

        <h3>My Thoughts About the Future</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AI will keep growing and becoming part of everyday life</li>
            <li>We need to learn how to work with AI, not just against it</li>
            <li>Responsible AI use is important for society</li>
            <li>Programming and logic skills are still essential for CS students</li>
            <li>AI can help solve big problems, but human creativity will always matter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Overall, AI excites me. It’s a tool that can make our lives better if used wisely. As a student, I want to keep learning, experiment with AI projects, and maybe even contribute to building AI that helps people in meaningful ways.
